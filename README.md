# simpleGame001

Just a simple game where you control a green box with the cursor.

You start with 10 Health Points and 3 red rectangles as your enemies.

You loose some HP every time an enemy hits you.

Every 4 seconds the difficulty is increased as a new enemy spawns.

When you loose all your HP the game is over and the time you have survived is displayed.

You can then restart the game if you want.
